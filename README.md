# Programming-exercises
This repository contains scripts that were part of various programming exercises

- "barcode_maker" : This script produces a list (variable length) of six letter sequences (consiting only of ACGT). The list will only contain sequences which differ in at least 3 positions. The script will also give a distance matrix to verify the results.

- "highest_scoring_path" : This script reads a file containing a Directed Acyclig Graph (having one root node). The ultimate output is the path, which has the highest sum of edge labels.
