# Programming-exercises
This repository contains scripts that were part of various programming exercises

- "barcode_maker" : This Perl script produces a list (variable length) of six letter sequences (based on four letters: ACGT). The list will only contain sequences which differ in at least 3 positions. The script will also give a distance matrix to verify the results.

- "highest_scoring_path" : This Perl script reads a file containing a Directed Acyclig Graph (having one root node). The ultimate output is the path, which has the highest sum of edge labels. 

- "habit_tracker" : There are python scripts that can be used as a simple habit tracker, e.g. tracking daily habits like exercise etc. Habits can be created and tracked over time (saved within a csv file). There is also the option to analyze the tracked habits.
